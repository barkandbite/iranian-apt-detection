# Iranian APT Unique Signatures and Detection Capabilities

## Executive Summary

This document details the unique behavioral signatures and detection capabilities added to the Bark&Bite Iranian APT detection suite that go beyond traditional CVE and IOC-based detection. These rules focus on Iranian-specific TTPs, cultural artifacts, and emerging attack vectors.

## Unique Iranian APT Characteristics

### 1. DNS Hijacking at Scale

Iranian APT groups, particularly those tracked as Lyceum/Hexane, have pioneered DNS hijacking techniques that differ from traditional attacks:

- **Let's Encrypt Certificate Abuse**: Iranian actors obtain legitimate Let's Encrypt certificates for hijacked domains to avoid SSL warnings
- **DNS NS Record Manipulation**: They change nameserver records at registrars rather than just A records
- **TXT Record C2 Communication**: Use of DNS TXT records for command and control, allowing bidirectional communication

**Detection Rules**:
- Suricata SIDs: 2000060-2000066
- Wazuh Rule IDs: 101000-101001

### 2. Time Zone and Working Hour Patterns

Iran operates on UTC+3:30 (IRST), a unique half-hour offset that provides behavioral detection opportunities:

- **Business Hours Activity**: 9 AM - 5 PM Tehran time (05:30 - 13:30 UTC)
- **Persian Calendar Alignment**: Activity patterns align with Iranian holidays and weekends (Thursday-Friday)
- **Sustained Campaigns**: 2-3 hour windows of intensive lateral movement

**Detection Rules**:
- Suricata SID: 2000069
- Wazuh Rule IDs: 101002-101003

### 3. Persian/Farsi Language Artifacts

Unique language indicators in malware and network traffic:

- **Farsi Resource Sections**: Found in DROPSHOT, SHAPESHIFT malware families
- **Persian Unicode in DNS**: Encoded Persian text in DNS queries for covert communication
- **Language Headers**: HTTP Accept-Language headers with "fa-IR" from external IPs

**Detection Rules**:
- Suricata SIDs: 2000067-2000068
- Wazuh Rule IDs: 101004-101005

### 4. Cryptocurrency Mining as Secondary Objective

Iranian APTs uniquely use cryptomining for both funding and distraction:

- **XMRig Deployment**: Post-exploitation installation of Monero miners
- **Federal Network Targeting**: Documented cases of mining on U.S. government systems
- **Resource Hijacking**: Using victim infrastructure for sanctions evasion

**Detection Rules**:
- Suricata SIDs: 2000070-2000071
- Wazuh Rule IDs: 101006-101007, 101020-101021

### 5. Advanced DNS Tunneling Techniques

Iranian groups have developed sophisticated DNS tunneling methods:

- **Hex Pattern Encoding**: Using patterns like `[a-f0-9]{8}.[a-f0-9]{8}.[a-f0-9]{8}`
- **Base64 in DNS**: Full base64 encoded commands in DNS queries
- **TXT Record Commands**: Using TXT records with prefixes like "cmd", "exec", "download"

**Detection Rules**:
- Suricata SIDs: 2000064-2000066
- Wazuh Rule IDs: 101008-101009

### 6. HYPERSCRAPE Email Theft Tool

APT35/Charming Kitten's custom tool for email harvesting:

- **Outdated Browser Spoofing**: Uses old browser user agents to force basic HTML view
- **Language Manipulation**: Changes account language to English, then reverts
- **Bulk Download**: Downloads emails as .eml files and marks as unread

**Detection Rules**:
- Suricata SIDs: 2000072-2000073
- Wazuh Rule IDs: 101010-101011

### 7. PowerLess Backdoor

Phosphorus group's evasion technique:

- **PowerShell without powershell.exe**: Runs PowerShell in .NET context
- **Process Injection**: Loads System.Management.Automation.dll into non-PowerShell processes
- **Base64 HTTP POST**: Sends encoded commands via HTTP POST

**Detection Rules**:
- Suricata SID: 2000074
- Wazuh Rule ID: 101012

### 8. Passive Implants (No Outbound C2)

UNC1860's innovative approach to avoid detection:

- **Inbound Only**: Waits for connections, never initiates outbound
- **Off-Hours Access**: Typically accessed 22:00-06:00 local time
- **Bearer Token Auth**: Uses Authorization: Bearer headers for authentication

**Detection Rules**:
- Suricata SIDs: 2000075-2000076
- Wazuh Rule ID: 101013

### 9. Specific Application Targeting

Iranian focus on communication and password management tools:

- **Telegram**: Stealing session files, databases, and keys
- **KeePass**: Targeting .kdbx password databases
- **Signal/WhatsApp**: Mobile messaging app data theft

**Detection Rules**:
- Suricata SIDs: 2000077-2000078
- Wazuh Rule IDs: 101014-101015

### 10. Email-Based C2 (BladedFeline)

8+ year persistence through compromised Exchange servers:

- **SMTP Command Channel**: Uses email subjects with patterns like `[A-Z]{3,5}[0-9]{4,8}`
- **Base64 Email Bodies**: Commands and data encoded in email content
- **Compromised Infrastructure**: Leverages victim's own email servers

**Detection Rules**:
- Suricata SID: 2000079
- Wazuh Rule ID: 101016

## Emerging Attack Vectors
